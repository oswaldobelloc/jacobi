#' @param z complex number
#' @param tau lattice parameter, a complex number with strictly positive 
#'   imaginary part; the two complex numbers \code{tau} and \code{q} are 
#'   related by \code{q = exp(1i*pi*tau)}, and only one of them must be 
#'   supplied
#' @param q the nome, a complex number whose modulus is strictly less than one, 
#'   and which is not zero nor a negative real number
